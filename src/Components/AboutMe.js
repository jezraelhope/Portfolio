			<p className="about-me-p">
			I've always thought that this field is only for people who are incredibly smart.
			Fast foward to the present and I have already created several websites from scratch by teaching myself how to code.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p className="about-me-p">
			I am fascinated by turning ideas into beautiful, interactive pages and I am in love with the process of creating them.
			I found that I learn the most when I face a difficult problem. It is so fulfilling when you find a solution to a problem that makes you scratch your head.
			</p>

			<p className="about-me-p">
			When I am not immersed in trying how to center a div, I enjoy painting, interior decorating, reading fantasy books, tending to my plants, annoying my husband and trying to put together an all white puzzle.
