        I am fascinated by turning ideas into beautiful, interactive pages. The
        creation process is so fulfilling to me, and I live for the moments when
        I face a difficult problem and then finally find the solution and it
        ends up working!

        interior decorating, reading fantasy books, tending to my plants,
        annoying my husband and trying to put together an all white puzzle.
